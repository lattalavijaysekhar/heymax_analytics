# Superset Dashboard Setup

1. Connect Superset to BigQuery
2. Add tables `dim_users` and `fct_events` as datasets
3. Create charts:
   - DAU/WAU/MAU: Count distinct user_id over time
   - New vs Retained: Compare first_seen vs activity
   - Triangle Retention: Cohort matrix
4. Pin charts to a dashboard
